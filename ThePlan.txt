The Plan for what I do about AI extinction risk
-----------------------------------------------

Change people's minds about AI extinction risk
  - Write letter to my Minister of Parliament asking her to read Yudkowsky Time article. Done!
  - Become a premium member on Sceptoid and write letter to Brian Dunning requesting episode on AI extinction risk. IN PROGRESS.
  - Become the go-to person at work on AI tools, and start discussions of mundane risk and then extinction risk. IN PROGRESS.

Donate to AI alignment fund
  - Already donating 11% pretax income without life impact, so I could increase that by 5% and send the difference to an AI alignment fund like Future Life Institute. TO DO.

Learn how to do AI alignment research
  - Tried doing SERIMATS starting materials. Got stuck on learning matrices. This would require at least 20hrs a week to progress. This would require leaving my fulltime job, since at least half my free time is spent caring for infant. ON HOLD.
  - Reading general intro maths books. I'm a quarter of the way through Maths Unwrapped by Ribbing & Sundin. IN PROGRESS.
