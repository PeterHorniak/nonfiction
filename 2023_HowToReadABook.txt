*My context*
- Was recommended by guest Andy Matuschak on Lunar Society podcast.
- I like to read. A day without an hour in a book means something went terribly wrong. Was excited to hear that maybe I was doing it wrong, and maybe there's a way to read even more per unit of time.

- Chapter 2 about teaching elementary reading and the teaching approaches are predictably out of date. Interesting bit was how both the author's time, and past generation , and founding time of US considered universal literacy important, and it was sn open problem. From what I heard in the Sold A Story podcast, this remains an open problem.
- Style is wordy and most of it can be skimmed.
- Preface
