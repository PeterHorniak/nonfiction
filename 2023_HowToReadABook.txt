1972 edition.
- Was recommended by guest ... on Lunar Society podcast.
- I like to read. A day without an hour in a book means something went terribly wrong. Wanted to know if I was doing it right.
- Chapter 2 about teaching elementary reading are predictably out of date
- Style is wordy and most of it can be skimmed.
