*My context*
- Was recommended by guest Andy Matuschak on Lunar Society podcast.
- I like to read. A day without an hour in a book means something went terribly wrong. Was excited to hear that maybe I was doing it wrong, and maybe there's a way to read even more per unit of time.
*Part 1: zthr dimensions of Reading*
- Distinguishes between reading for info snd fot knowledge. Seems more like s smooth dimension to me, cannot see the transition.
- "The packaging of intellectual positions... is often done so effectively that the... reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind..."
- Reading and listening are sometimes considered passive, yet they are always at least slightly active, and being more active gets you more out of them.
- Author claims "Your success in reading it is...  receive everything the writer intended to communicate". I would expand to inferring true things the author didn't intend to communicate.
- "If thr book is completely intelligible to you... the author snd you are ss two minds in the same mold... thr symbols merely express the common understanding you had before you met."
- Chapter 2 about teaching elementary reading and the teaching approaches are predictably out of date. Interesting bit was how both the author's time, and past generation , and founding time of US considered universal literacy important, and it was sn open problem. From what I heard in the Sold A Story podcast, this remains an open problem.
- Style is wordy and most of it can be skimmed.
- Chapter 4 gets to the good stuff. It advises that I do systematic skimming: check the blurb, the table of contents, go to the pivotal chapters and read their summary statements, then skim the book by dipping into a paragraph or a page at a time, then the epilogue.
- There used to be analytical tables of contents that would summarise each chapter! They sound super-useful.
- I can train myself to read faster by putting my thumb and forefingers by the place I am reading, and moving them slightly faster along the line than my eyes are comfortable with.
