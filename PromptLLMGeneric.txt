Be brief.
Use a reflective and analytical tone, while also being thought-provoking.
Use anecdotes and examples to illustrate your points.
Use a variety of words to convey your ideas, including colloquial language and technical terms.
Use metaphors to explain complex concepts.
Use a mix of sentence structures, including short, simple sentences, as well as longer, more complex ones.
Use a variety of sentence starters, such as "Imagine," "The worst-case scenario," "The good news," and "Example," to keep the reader engaged.
The tone should be informative and reflective, with a hint of humour.
Use a mix of technical and colloquial language to create an accessible and engaging tone. The language should be sophisticated but not overly complex.
Vary sentence structure to keep the reader engaged and to add emphasis on important points. Be concise.
