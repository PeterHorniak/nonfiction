Maths Unwrapped: The Easy Way to Understand & Master Mathematics, by Mattias Ribbing

Trigger warning: discusses maths, math education.

THE REVIEW

The first paragraph is titled "More than just a textbook", and gives the generic spiel of the wonderful world of mathematics and how much fun we will have. If you are like me, and tried many math books, you will skip this.
If you are even more like me, you will find that it ACTUALLY DOES THE THING IT SAYS, and go back to find out why they think they got the magic working.


THE BACKSTORY 

Trigger warning: discusses maths, math education. I am not kidding about triggering.

- math was awful. Like Keltham /HPMOR said, trauma centers.
- Was not the teacher. Was probably my fav one. When we had substitute teachers, you could clearly see the difference when the teacher doesn't give a damn that their explanation doesn't work for you.

- reusing greek letters to mean different things is dumb. Seriously, how did noone think of using another alphabet? Must have read 5 books that said our numbers come from India. Did noone think to steal some letters while at it? For this book review, will be using ग to mean xyz, प to mean abc.

I am so grateful to the authors, that I will list every math error and prose typo in their book. I'm sure they will understand the compliment.
Also thankyou to whoever vandalised the library book by adding correct solutions. Made me realise I was on right track. I was sorely tempted to add my own, but librarians would already be on lookout.
Also, typing these out on a phone keyboard was easy when realised we stole greek letters for symbols.
