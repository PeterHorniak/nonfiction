Maths Unwrapped: The Easy Way to Understand & Master Mathematics, by Mattias Ribbing

Trigger warning: discusses maths, math education.

THE REVIEW

The first paragraph is titled "More than just a textbook", and gives the generic spiel of the wonderful world of mathematics and how much fun we will have. If you are like me, and tried many math books, you will skip this.
If you are even more like me, you will find that it ACTUALLY DOES THE THING IT SAYS, and go back to find out why they think they got the magic working.


THE BACKSTORY 
- math was awful. Like Keltham /HPMOR said, trauma centers.
- Was not the teacher. Was probably my fav one. When we had substitute teachers, you could clearly see the difference when the teacher doesn't give a damn that their explanation doesn't work for you.

I am so grateful to the authors, that I will list every math error and prose typo in their book. I'm sure they will understand the compliment.
